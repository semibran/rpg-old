* __piece__: An individual unit, analogous to a piece in chess or checkers. Can move around the playfield and perform actions as specified by the player or an AI-controlled opponent.
* __stat__: A value that determines the efficiency of individual unit actions. For example, the Speed (SPD) stat might affect how far or how fast a unit moves.
* __cell__: A unique position on the map grid, modelled using an `( x, y )` tuple.
* __map__: The finite space where units move and interact.
* __tile__: An environmental hazard within a map with special properties. These might affect unit stats, restore hit points, or impede movement.
* __layout__: A collection of tiles arranged in grid form.
